# Montana's Code Repository 

Welcome to my code repository! Feel free to use any of the code here. Most of it has been generated for the purpose of anayzing isotope and community data. I tend to keep my own data in the `data` folder and have saved graphics in the `graphics` folder. All scripts are designed to have the project directory set as their working directory. 

<br>

I have tried to label all scripts in progress with `_P`. All scripts without that label should run smoothly. Below is an inventory with brief descriptions of the code included. 

Thanks!
-Montana 


`size_at_age_bass.R` - Joins the `.csv` files needed to examine age at size. Plots visualizations. 

`size_comparisons.R` - Uses `isotope_functions` to quickly plot species sizes in data files that do not match data base formatting. 

`LML_community_P.R` - Working script for LML, community, SMB removal project. 

`Littoral_CPUE_P.R` - MA2276 go through and see if I actually need this file. Could delete. 

`Lab_meeting_graphs_P.R` - Visualizations of LML SMB and community. Needs editing - does not stand alone. 

`Bass_CPUE.Rmd` - 

`Bass_Planning.R`

`CPUE_calculations.R`

`Data` - Contains data files 

`Graphics` - Saved graphics files 

`Isotopes` - Code specific to isotope research
