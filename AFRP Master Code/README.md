# AFRP Master Code Repository

Welcome to the master repository for all code that is widely applicable to analysis of AFRP data. This folder should not contain personal code or personal scripts that are in progress. The code here can be copied into your own personal scripts so that these files remain unaltered. Please feel free to add any script that you feel would be useful to the lab!

Below is an inventory of the code contained in this file and its general purpose. 

Thanks!

#### Code Inventory 


##### The following files are used to load in AFRP data, filter it, and do several simple data wrangling manipulations. 


`AFRP_Function.html` - Illustrative document describing how to use the functions to manipulate data

`AFRP_Function.Rmd` - Markdown file used to create `AFRP_Function.html`

`AFRP_Functions.R` - Contains the actual functions. This needs to be loaded into scripts to use existing functions using `source("AFRP_Functions")` at the top of your script.
