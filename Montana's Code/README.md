# Montana's Code Repository 

Welcome to my code repository! Feel free to use any of the code here. Most of it has been generated for the purpose of anayzing isotope and community data. I tend to keep my own data in the `data` folder and have saved graphics in the `graphics` folder.

I have tried to label all scripts in progress with `working`. All scripts without that label should run smoothly. Below is an inventory with brief descriptions of the code included. 

Thanks!
