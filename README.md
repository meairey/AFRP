# AFRP Code Repository 

-------------------------------------

##### Welcome! Here is the central repository for any code being used for AFRP research. 

<br>

All master code is kept in the folder 'AFRP Master Code'. Personal code relevant to the program can be stored in your own personal folders. For example: `MA2276_Code`. 

<br>

This workflow contains several functions housed in the 'functions.R' file in the folder 'AFRP Master Code'. Please see that folder for detailed information on their usage.
